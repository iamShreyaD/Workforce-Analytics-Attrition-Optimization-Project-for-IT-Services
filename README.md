# Workforce-Analytics-Attrition-Optimization-Project-for-IT-Services
_Predictive & Explainable Modeling for Proactive Workforce Retention_

## 📊 Project Overview
This project applies **machine learning, SQL-based validation, and Power BI analytics** to transform employee attrition from a historical HR metric into a **predictive workforce risk signal**.

Using a real-world HR dataset, the project uncovers:
- Employees at elevated attrition risk
- Structural and demographic drivers of attrition
- Actionable insights through *explainable machine learning*

The solution integrates **data auditing, predictive modeling, and executive-ready dashboards**, enabling leadership teams to take **proactive, data-driven retention actions**.

## 🧬 Dataset Source
- Kaggle: [Employee Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/HRAnalyticRepository/employee-attrition-data)
- Size: **49,648 employee records**
- Multi-year workforce snapshots
- Attrition rate: **~3%**
- Attributes include demographic, organizational, tenure, and job-level features  

This dataset reflects **real-world class imbalance**, making it suitable for applied predictive modeling and responsible ML evaluation.

## 🎯 Dashboards & KPIs

### Dashboard 1 — *Workforce & Attrition Insights*
![Dashboard 1](Images/Dashboard%201.png)

**Objective:**  
Provide a **descriptive and diagnostic foundation** for understanding workforce composition and historical attrition patterns prior to predictive modeling.

**Key Visuals**
- Workforce stability 
- Attrition rate over time
- Attrition by department
- Attrition by business unit
- Attrition by tenure band

**KPIs**
- Total Employees
- Active Employees
- Terminated Employees
- Attrition Rate
- Early Exit Percentage
- Average Tenure

**Business Value**  
Validates KPI logic, data integrity, and workforce trends, ensuring a strong analytical baseline before introducing machine-learning predictions.

### Dashboard 2 — *Attrition Risk & Prediction*
![Dashboard 1](Images/Dashboard%202.png)

**Objective:**  
Translate machine-learning predictions into **actionable, explainable workforce risk insights** for HR and leadership teams.

**Key Visuals**
- Attrition risk distribution (Low / Medium / High)
- Average predicted risk by department *(with tooltip)*
- Average predicted risk by job title *(with tooltip)*
- Risk concentration by driver category
- Model explainability: feature importance
- High-risk employee analysis (aggregated, non-identifying)

**Tooltip Design (Explainability Layer)**

- Attrition Risk Distribution

## 🧪 Machine Learning & Model Performance

| Model | ROC-AUC | Key Characteristics |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.88 | High interpretability, strong baseline |
| Random Forest | **0.94** | Best performance, captures non-linear patterns |

**Model Selection:** Random Forest  
Selected for superior predictive accuracy while retaining transparency through feature importance analysis.

**Key Insights**
- Short tenure is a strong stabilizing factor against attrition
- Age, job role, and location contribute meaningfully to attrition risk
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest highlight **consistent top drivers**, reinforcing model reliability
