📌 These are directly tied to your DAX measures
📌 This proves Power BI + business alignment

🔹 Section B — Attrition Trend Analysis

Visuals

Line chart:

Attrition Rate by Year

Line or clustered column:

Insight this communicates

“Attrition is not static — it changes over time.”

Use bar / column charts:

Attrition Rate by Department

Attrition Rate by Job Title

Attrition Rate by Business Unit

Attrition Rate by City / Store

📌 Sort by highest attrition
📌 Add tooltips with counts

🔹 Section D — Tenure & Demographics

Visuals

📌 Risk bands (example):

High: > 0.7

Medium: 0.4–0.7

Low: < 0.4

🔹 Section B — Attrition Risk Distribution

Visuals

Histogram / bar:

Predicted attrition probability

Donut:

Risk category split

📌 This visually communicates model output without math.

🔹 Section C — Risk by Business Dimension

Visuals

Avg predicted risk by Department

Avg predicted risk by Job Title

Avg predicted risk by Business Unit

Avg predicted risk by City / Store

📌 This directly aligns with Random Forest importance

🔹 Section D — Explainability Panel (Critical)

Visuals

Bar chart:

Top 10 attrition drivers (from B4)

Text box:

Business interpretations (static narrative)

🧠 HOW INTERVIEWERS WILL READ THIS

They’ll think:

“This person doesn’t just build models — they understand how analytics is used in real organizations.”

That’s mid-level DS perception.
